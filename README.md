# MLAPI_Base
Basic multiplayer project using MLAPI

You can start a Server using the PC version, this will launch the project, click Server and a server will be started. You can then join the server. All players are visible on the server.

You can start the game and click host to become a server and client.

You can start the game and click Start Client. This will join a server or host. You will need to enter the ip address in the InputField.

The Dedicated Server No Gui build doesn't work. I didn't try to fix it yet.

This project was just thrown together to check out some MLAPI functions.
